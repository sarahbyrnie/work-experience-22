# 2022 DAFNI Work Eperience
This is a repository for work completed by the 2022 work eperience student in DAFNI. Work will be towards the rail data ingestion epic.


## Planned Work
The initial plan for the work experience week is to create graphs to somehow display the data held in CIF files. Below are some initial ideas, which may be expanded on or disregarded in favour of other ideas as the week progresses:
 - graphs showing the number of trains run per day from varying operators
 - a heat map of arrivals and departures by region or nationwide
